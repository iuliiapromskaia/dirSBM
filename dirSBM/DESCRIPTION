Description: A Dirichlet stochastic block model is a model-based clustering 
    framework for directed weighted networks with compositional edge attributes, 
    i.e. the sum of weights sent by each individual node of the network is 1. The 
    vector of weights of each node is modelled using a Dirichlet distribution, 
    conditionally on the set of cluster labels of the sender node and all the receivers. 
    The model is implemented within the hybrid maximum likelihood framework using 
    variational classification expectation-maximisation algorithm, and the choice of the number 
    of clusters is addressed using the Integrated Completed Likelihood criterion.
